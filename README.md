# Hey! 👋  
I'm Enrique — a full-stack developer who enjoys building things that actually work.

When I run into a problem, I dig until I find the best way to solve it.  
I don’t over-explore — I focus on getting things done and moving forward.

My main stack these days is **React**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
I care about clean UIs, secure APIs, and making apps feel smooth and reliable.

Here you’ll find a mix of personal projects, experiments, and stuff I build to simplify real-world workflows.  
Most of my day-to-day code lives in private repos at work, so I'm working on bringing more **personal** projects here.

### A few things about me:
- I code with a straightforward mindset: understand the issue → fix it → ship it.  
- I often break things on purpose just to understand how they behave.  
- I do CrossFit almost every day — it keeps me sane while debugging.  
- I like building tools that help people work faster and cleaner.  
- I’m pushing myself to create and publish more personal, non-work projects.

If you ever want to collaborate or just talk dev stuff, I'm around.  
Always building, always improving. 🚀
